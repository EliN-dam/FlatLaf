FlatLaf Change Log
==================

## 0.44-SNAPSHOT

#### New features and improvements

- TabbedPane: Replaced forward/backward scrolling arrow buttons with "Show
  Hidden Tabs" button. If pressed, it shows a popup menu that contains (partly)
  hidden tabs and selecting one activates that tab. If you prefer
  forward/backward buttons, use `UIManager.put(
  "TabbedPane.hiddenTabsNavigation", "arrowButtons" )`. (PR #190; issue #40)
- TabbedPane: Support split forward/backward scrolling buttons. Backward button
  is on the left/top side of the tabs area, forward button on the right/bottom
  side. Optionally hide disabled buttons. (PR #195; issue #40)
- TabbedPane: Support scrolling tabs with mouse wheel (if `tabLayoutPolicy` is
  `SCROLL_TAB_LAYOUT`). (PR #187; issue #40)
- TabbedPane: Repeat scrolling as long as arrow buttons are pressed. (PR #187;
  issue #40)
- TabbedPane: Support adding custom components to left and right sides of tabs
  area. (set client property `JTabbedPane.leadingComponent` or
  `JTabbedPane.trailingComponent` to a `java.awt.Component`) (issue #40)
- TabbedPane: Support closable tabs. (PR #193; issues #31 and #40)
- Support painting separator line between window title and content (use UI value
  `TitlePane.borderColor`). (issue #184)


#### Fixed bugs

- Custom window decorations: Not visible menu bar is now ignored in layout.
- Popups using `JToolTip` components did not respect their location. (issue
  #188; regression in 0.42 in fix for #164)


## 0.43

#### New features and improvements

- TabbedPane: Support hiding separator between tabs and content area (set client
  property `JTabbedPane.showContentSeparator` to `false`).
- CheckBoxMenuItem and RadioButtonMenuItem: Improved checkmark background colors
  of selected menu items that have also an icon. This makes it is easier to
  recognize selected menu items.

  readability. (issue #174)
- PasswordField: Support disabling Caps Lock warning icon. (issue #172)

#### Fixed bugs

- Custom window decorations: Fixed wrong window placement when moving window to
  another screen with different scaling factor. (issue #166)

## 0.41

#### New features and improvements

- Hide label, button and tab mnemonics by default and show them only when
  <kbd>Alt</kbd> is pressed. (issue #4)
- If a JButton has an icon and no text, then it does not get a minimum width
  (usually 72 pixel) and the left and right insets are same as top/bottom insets
  so that it becomes square (if the icon is square).
- Changed styling of default button in "Flat Light" theme (wide blue border
  instead of blue background).
- Added Java 9 module descriptor `module-info.class` to `flatlaf.jar` (in
  `META-INF/versions/9`). But FlatLaf remains Java 8 compatible. (issue #1)
- Support specifying custom scale factor in system properties `flatlaf.uiScale`
  or `sun.java2d.uiScale`. E.g. `-Dflatlaf.uiScale=1.5`. (Java 8 only)
